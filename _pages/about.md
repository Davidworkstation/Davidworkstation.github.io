As a Risk Operational Analyst with Honolulu Disposal Service, I engage with the intricacies of data to navigate the complexities of operational risk. My educational path at the University of Hawaii, where I studied Economics and Psychology with a focus on Econometrics and Research Methods, has equipped me with the analytical acumen to transform data into strategic assets. This expertise is demonstrated through my initiative in establishing a comprehensive data infrastructure, incorporating tools such as Power BI and Python, to streamline and enhance our analytical processes.

My professional journey includes a significant academic collaboration with Professor Gunter Meissner, which produced the research paper titled "Kurtosis: a poor measure of risk." In this project, I programmed over 15 statistical models to critically evaluate and challenge traditional measures of risk, utilizing advanced relationships in probability distributions. This research not only honed my analytical skills but also highlighted my ability to approach complex risk assessments with a fresh perspective.

Fluent in programming languages like Python, Julia, and R, and with a firm grasp of web development and computational principles, my goal is to seamlessly transition into the finance sector. Here, I aspire to apply my data dexterity to fortify financial strategies and risk resolution.

Originating from the vibrant landscapes of Hawaii, my passion for exploration transcends the professional sphere, as I revel in the rich tapestry of cultures experienced through my travels. This global perspective is a silent partner in my analytical pursuits, reminding me that data, much like life, is an adventure â€” best navigated with agility and an open mind.
